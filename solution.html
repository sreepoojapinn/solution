        <p>Here are seven zoo alternatives that offer interesting and unique learning experiences that will get you close to animals, without the burden of a guilty conscience:</p>
          <h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Farm Animal Sanctuary- There are many wonderful organizations around the country (and the world) that have set up sanctuaries for rescued farm animals, who otherwise, most likely would have ended up on someone’s plate.</li>
            <li>Explore a Tidepool, Creek, or River- Water is the source of life and bodies of water teem with a myriad of interesting animal and plant species. Take a trip down to the closest tidepool, creek, or river and keep your eyes peeled for wildlife in all directions — in the water, on the land, and in the sky.</li>
            <li>Wildlife Rehabilitation Center- Visiting a wildlife rehabilitation center is a great way to learn about the specific species that reside in your geographic area. Many centers offer tours of their facilities and are home to animals that are not able to be released back into the wild.</li>
            <li>Bird Observatory- No matter where you live, there are sure to be birds in abundance. Check your area for nearby bird observatories, which will give you a great vantage point for admiring the beauty and splendor of our feathered friends. Don’t forget your binoculars and your camera!</li>
            <li>Try Your Own Backyard- It’s remarkable what we can discover when we really open our eyes to our surroundings — especially those that we take for granted each day. Head to your backyard (or to your local park if you don’t have a backyard) and go on a bug or bird safari: take photos of the different species you observe, make a scrapbook of the images, then do some research to identify all of your finds.</li>
            <li>Beach Walk- If you live near a coastline, take advantage of your location’s beaches and the unique assortment of plant and animal life that they offer. A guided beach walk will introduce you to so many wonderful, interesting things, but if you can’t find any guided walks in your area, consider heading out on your own to do some nature watching.</li>
            <li>Eco-vacation- or the ultimate, up-close nature experience, consider taking an eco-vacation. There are many companies spanning all continents that offer guided experiences that will take you into nature, without disturbing it, for an experience like none other. Most reputable companies in this industry have stringent operational practices and are heavily involved in conservation efforts. Check out See The Wild, The International Ecotourism Society, or The International Ecotourism Club if an eco-vacation sounds like your dream vacation.</li>
